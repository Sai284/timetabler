## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/timetable-app.git
   cd timetable-app/server

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a .env file in the server folder.

   ```.env
   PORT=5001
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/timetable_db
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

4. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
   - Create a new database:

  ```bash
  createdb timetable_db
  ```
  run the provided schema file to set up the tables:
  ```bash
  psql -d timetable_db -f schema.sql
  ```

5. ***Frontend Setup***
   In server directory:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   In client directory:
   npm start

## Usage
Dashboard:
When users navigate to the app, they are taken directly to the Dashboard.

The Dashboard displays aggregated session data and any previously saved sessions.

A "Generate Timetable" button redirects users to a multi-step form.

Multi-Step Form:

Step 1: Enter subjects and exam dates.

Step 2: Enter study preferences (study days per week, hours per day, start/end times).

Step 3: Enter exclusion dates and reasons.

On submitting the form, the app calls the timetable generation endpoint, saves the generated timetable in local storage, and redirects back to the Dashboard.

Saving Timetable:
If a generated timetable exists, the Dashboard shows a "Save Timetable" button, which persists the sessions to the database.

Calendar Export:
Users can export their saved sessions to an ICS file by clicking the "Export Timetable" button.

Automatic Clearing:
The app is configured to clear all sessions from the database on each page refresh (for demo purposes).
